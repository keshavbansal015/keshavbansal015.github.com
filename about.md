Hi, I am just a normal guy interested in CS, with a dream to not be obsoleted by AI.  
Growing up in New Delhi, India I didn't have much exposure to computers. But gradually through my undergrad and masters I realized how interesting this field can be.
I am not a good programmer right now, but hopefully one day. I want to work with awesome people, provide awesome products and service to the world.

**Some other points about me:**

<!-- * Love animals (specially the furry ones.) -->

- I cook sometimes.
- Always ready for a game of chess. Let's go!

**Currently I am working on these things:**

- Get better at Development
- Exploring system design
- Exploring AWS
- Database internals
- Learn about distributed systems

**Goals for this year:**

- Code.code..code...
- Get a job
<!-- * Pray consistently -->
<!-- - Become a better human being -->
