Hi, I am just a normal guy interested in CS, with a dream to not be obsoleted by AI.  
Growing up in a normal family in New Delhi, India I didn't have much exposure to computers. But gradually through my undergrad and masters I realized how interesting this field can be.
I am not a good programmer right now, but hopefully one day. I want to work with extra awesome people building awesome things providing awesome products and service to the world. 

__Some other points about me:__

* Love animals (specially the furry ones.)
* I cook sometimes.
* Always ready for a game of chess. Let's go!

__Currently I am working on these things:__

* Getting a little better at web development. 
* Exploring the subject of system design.
* RDBMS internals.
* And hopefully give sometime to distributed systems.

__Goals for this year:__

* Code.code..code...
* Get a job.
* Pray consistently.
* Become a better human being.
