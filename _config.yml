# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
# I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Texas at Arlington, with a strong academic background, including a 4.0 GPA in my Master's program. I'm looking for spring internships and full-time software developer roles. My technical skills include Java, Python, C++, React, TensorFlow, Linux, and AWS. My experience spans roles such as Graduate Teaching Assistant, Software Developer Intern, and Python Teaching Assistant. I've worked on projects in cloud computing, SQL, and AI algorithms, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
